Learn the soup to nuts of how missions like these become a reality, and how NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is using design thinking to improve its mission design practices. You’ll hear firsthand stories of how user experience design fits into an 80 year old process, and how it’s changing the ways that NASA approaches unmanned exploration of the solar system and beyond.

        Many creative leaders have stepped into their leadership role simply because they were great designers. Very few get training or focused mentorship to hone their leadership skills. Most of us learned and learn through trial and error. In this personal talk Elle will share insights from her own learning process and her ongoing inquiry into the skills it takes to spearhead design projects across media, architecture, storytelling and technology. How to build great teams? How to generate ideas that generate ideas in others? How to inspire and nurture teams as well as clients? How to deal with inevitable frustrations? How to push projects beyond mediocrity and people out of their comfort zone without pushing them over the edge? She will also present her project for the ARoS Art Museum in Denmark as an in-depth case study. This will provide attendees with a behind-the-scenes look at Local Project’s process and “Prototype First” approach. She will show how they broke all the rules to make art social, and deliver towards the mandate of a “Mental Fitness Center.
