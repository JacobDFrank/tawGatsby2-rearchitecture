      "bio": "Raised in Bend, Oregon, John had an early affinity for mobile machinery. Army vehicles, tanks, scenes of car races were early drawing themes. Movies like Battle of Britain, The Great Waldo Pepper, and Star Wars formed lasting influences, the latter forging a link to a future career in industrial design. With a Bachelor of Science degree (with honors) from Art Center, vehicle design work for a variety of clients such as Boeing, Hasbro, John Deere and Activision led to a career at Honda R&D where John is Principal Designer, digital modeling group leader. In his spare creative time, he is obsessively putting ink to paper and churning out concepts, collecting vinyl records, and enjoying the best ramen, Sichuan food, and craft beer that he can track down.",

Creating an engaging, memorable design is a mad feat of juggling multiple customer needs, aesthetic considerations, and injecting newness. Sitting down with a blank piece of paper can be paralyzing without a good process. With more than 20 years of design experience, John A. Frye reveals some of the simple methods and tools he uses regularly to tackle new design projects with ease. "
